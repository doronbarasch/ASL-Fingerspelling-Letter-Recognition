# ASL-Fingerspelling-Letter-Recognition

The website and video for this project can be found at: https://doronbarasch.github.io/ASL-Fingerspelling-Letter-Recognition/

Included in this repository are the Python files we used to train the neural nets, to run the webcam and use the neural nets, and the model itself. In addition, some of the neural nets we trained are located in the repository as well. The neural net used for the video is neural net 7.

The datasets we used for this project were from Kaggle and can be found at:

We combined all of the images (minus the test set from the second dataset) to compose the dataset, we some tweaking to ensure better models.
